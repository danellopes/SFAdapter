### Example of the Adapter

This example of the Adapter pattern was develop using Salesforce Apex language, but I've originally learned about this pattern in C#, so a few things changed, mainly the methods and syntax available.

The Adapter Design Pattern, akin to a tangible electrical adapter, caters to the varying power needs of different devices (5V, 110V, 220V) and the diverse power sockets across countries. This pattern involves creating interfaces that can be implemented and adapted according to these diverse requirements.

For instance, suppose you have a device that requires a 110V power supply, but you're in a country where the standard power socket delivers 220V. Here, an adapter would help convert the 220V power supply to a 110V one that your device can utilize.

Similarly, in software design, you might have a class or a module that expects a certain type of interface to work with. However, what you currently have might be a different interface. The Adapter Design Pattern can help bridge this gap by providing a way to translate or adapt the interface you have into the one you need.

This pattern, therefore, promotes interface compatibility, ensuring that disparate components of a system can work together seamlessly, despite their differing interface requirements.

### Adapter Caching

Caching in the context of the Adapter Design Pattern is a performance optimization strategy meant to speed up the system. It involves storing the results of complex calculations the first time they're computed. These results are stored in a cache with a unique key, often a hash value. When the adapter is called again with the same parameters, instead of repeating the costly computation, the system first checks the cache. If the result is in the cache (a 'cache hit'), it's returned directly, saving time and computational resources. If the result is not in the cache (a 'cache miss'), the calculation is performed, and the result stored in the cache for future use. This approach is particularly beneficial when the adapter is used frequently and the computations are resource-intensive.
